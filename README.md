This Task Manager app, built with Next.js and Chakra UI, allows users to efficiently manage tasks with features to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Each task includes a description, due date, category, and priority level. The app uses Redux for state management and provides user feedback through notifications. A splash screen enhances the initial user experience. The app's structure includes key components like `TaskManager`, `SplashScreen`, and a centralized state management slice (`tasksSlice.js`).
